Lightweightâ€‹ Docker image for TaskRabbit's [elasticdump](https://github.com/taskrabbit/elasticsearch-dump).

Installation
------------

The `pentimento/elasticdump` image requires Docker to be installed and configured. See [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for guidance.

The image must be pulled from Docker Hub before being used:

    $ docker pull pentimento/elasticdump
    
Check `pentimento/elasticdump` [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/pentimento/elasticdump/) for additional infos.

Usage
-----

Running elasticdump is pretty easy. Just run a Docker container from the image and pass arguments and options to it:

    $ docker run --rm -it pentimento/elasticdump --input=http://production.es.com:9200/my_index --output=http://staging.es.com:9200/my_index --type=mapping

Since the `pentimento/elasticdump` image tag numbers follow elasticdump versions numbering, you can also specify an elasticdump version by using Docker tags:

    $ docker run --rm -it pentimento/elasticdump:0.16.1 --input=http://production.es.com:9200/my_index --output=http://staging.es.com:9200/my_index --type=mapping

If no tag is provided, the latest version will be used.

See [elasticdump documentation](https://github.com/taskrabbit/elasticsearch-dump#use) for detailed usage.

`pentimento/elasticdump` is a mashup of great tools done by others:

* [elasticdump](https://github.com/taskrabbit/elasticsearch-dump): The one tool that is the reason for this project.
* [Alpine Linux Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/): A very lightweight Docker image `pentimento/elasticdump` is built upon.
